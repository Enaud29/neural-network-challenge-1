# Overview
Instructions:

	1.	Prepare the data for use on a neural network model.
	2.	Compile and evaluate a model using a neural network.
	3.	Predict loan repayment success using your neural network model.
	4.	Discuss creating a recommendation system for student loans.

Part 1: Prepare the Data for Use on a Neural Network Model

	1.	Read the Data: Import the student loans dataset from a provided URL into a Pandas DataFrame.
	2.	Create Features and Target Datasets: Define the target dataset by the “credit_ranking” column. Other columns define the features dataset.
	3.	Split the Data: Split the datasets into training and testing sets.
	4.	Scale the Features: Use StandardScaler from scikit-learn to scale the features dataset.

Part 2: Compile and Evaluate a Model Using a Neural Network

	1.	Create a Deep Neural Network: Use TensorFlow’s Keras to define the number of input features, layers, and neurons per layer based on the dataset’s features.
	2.	Compile and Fit the Model: Train the neural network model using the training data.
	3.	Evaluate the Model: Calculate the model’s loss and accuracy using the testing data.

These steps guide the preparation, training, evaluation, and potential application of a neural network model for predicting student loan repayment success.
